**IDCeMPy** is a Python package which:

* Makes it easy to compose and fit ordered probit models when your discrete outcome variable is "inflated"  in either the zero or middle categories without (ZiOP/MiOPC) and with correlated errors (ZiOPC/MiOPC).    
* Fits inflated multi-nomial logit (iMNL) models that account for the preponderant (and heterogeneous) share
of observations in the baseline or any other lower category in unordered polytomous choice
outcomes.
* Allows you to easily compute the goodness-of-fit tests (AIC and Log-likelihood) and assess the performance (Vuong Test) of the "inflated" choice models with respect to standard ordered probit (OP) and multi-nomial logit (MNL) models. 

**IDCeMPy** uses Newton numerical optimization methods to estimate the "inflated" discrete choice models described above via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).  
**IDCeMPY** is compatible with [Python](https://python.org) 3.7+

## Getting Started

You can try **IDCeMPy** now by downloading it from GitHub or PyPi.
On [readthedocs](https://ziopcpy.readthedocs.io/) you will find the installation guide, a complete overview of all the fueatures included in **IDCeMPy**, and example scripts of all the models. 

## Why **IDCeMPy**?

Researchers in natural and social sciences typically use Ordered Probit (OP) and Multi-Nomial Logit (MNL) models when working with discrete outcome variables that have more than two categories.  Using those models, however, may lead to biased inferences when:

* The lowest category of the outcome variable presents an excess of "zeros" (i.e. Zero Inflation) that are generated from different d.g.p's.
* An excessive number of observations are in the middle categories of the outcome variable (i.e. Middle Inflation), and generated by distinct d.g.p's.
* The lower outcome categories incorporate an
excessive share and heterogeneous pool of observations. 
  
**IDCePy** combines two probability distributions by estimating two latent (split and outcome-stage)
equations in zero and middle inflated OP models, and MNL models with unordered outcome variables, allowing to statistically assess the inflated share
of observations in your ordered outcome variable.

## Dependencies
- scipy
- numpy
- pandas

## Installation

From [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/ziopcpy/0.1.2/):

```sh
$ pip install ziopcpy
```

## Using the Package

We illustrate the functionality of ZiopcPy using data from Besley and Persson (2009) that is included and described in the package. Specifically, we estimate the effects of economic and political covariates on their ordered dependent variable, political violence, which is labeled as “rep_civwar_DV”.

Import `ZiopcPy` and other required packages:
```
from ziopcpy import ziopcpy
import pandas as pd
import urllib
```

```
url='https://github.com/hknd23/ziopcpy/raw/master/data/bp_exact_for_analysis.dta'
DAT=pd.read_stata(url)

# Specifying array of variable names (strings) X,Y,Z:
X = ['logGDPpc', 'parliament', 'disaster', 'major_oil', 'major_primary']
Z = ['logGDPpc', 'parliament']
Y = ['rep_civwar_DV']
```
#### Running the ZiOP, ZiOPC, and OP model

Users should define an array of starting parameters before estimating `ziop`, `ziopc`, or `op` models. 
```
# Starting parameters for optimization:
pstartziop=np.array( [-1.31, .32, 2.5, -.21,.2, -0.2, -0.4, 0.2,.9,-.4])
pstartziopc = np.array([-1.31, .32, 2.5, -.21, .2, -0.2, -0.4, 0.2, .9, -.4, .1])
pstartop = np.array([-1, 0.3, -0.2, -0.5, 0.2, .9, -.4])

```

### Estimation of `ziop`, `ziopc` or `op` models
```
# Model estimation:
ziop_JCR = ziopcpy.iopmod(pstartziop, data, X, Y, Z, method='bfgs', weights=1, offsetx=0, offsetz=0)
ziopc_JCR = ziopcpy.iopcmod(pstartziopc, data, X, Y, Z, method='bfgs', weights=1, offsetx=0, offsetz=0)
JCR_OP = ziopcpy.opmod(pstartop, data, X, Y, method='bfgs', weights=1, offsetx=0)
```
The estimation results from the table above are stored in the three classes `ZiopModel`, `ZiopcModel`, and `OpModel` with the following attributes:

  * *coefs*: Model coefficients and standard errors
  * *llik*: Log-likelihood
  * *AIC*: Akaike information criterion
  * *vcov*: Variance-covariance matrix
  
  The following table summarizes the results obtained from the three models (standard errors in parentheses)

The coefficients in the probit split-stage equation in the ZiOP(C) models reveal that ln GDP per capita has a negative and significant effect—while the parliament dummy has a negative but insignificant effect—on the likelihood of observations in the sample not being in the ‘‘always zero’’ group. The estimate of the parliament dummy is positive and insignificant in the outcome stage of the ZiOPC model, but negative and insignificant in the other two models. Other outcome stage coefficient estimates are largely similar. The estimate of the rho parameter in the ZiOPC model’s outcome stage is significant, which suggests that allowing for correlated disturbances between the two stages of the ZiOP is justified.  The Akaike information criterion (AIC) values reported for all the models in above table strongly favors the ZiOP and ZiOPC models over the OP model.

Users can obtain the values of the attributes by using the `print(Model_name.Attribute)` function. For example, to see the Variance-covariance matrix:

`ZiopcPy` also provides code to calculate and illustrate--from the estimated ZiOP(C) models’--the marginal effect (with 95% confidence intervals) of the (i) probit split-stage covariates on the probability of observations being in the always-zero group and (ii) OP outcome stage covariates on the probability of each outcome category. For example, from the Besley and Persson (2009) data, users can employ the relevant code to calculate and illustrate the marginal effect of the probit split-stage covariate--the parliamentary dummy--on the probability of observations entering the always-zero (versus not always-zero) group as:

![Marginal Effect of Split-stage Parliamentary Dummy (ZiOPC)](https://github.com/hknd23/ziopcpy/raw/master/graphics/ZiOPC_Parliament.png)

### Vuong Test

`ZiopcPy` also allows users to employ a variant of the Vuong test developed by Harris and Zhao (2007) to compare the performance of the OP model to both the ZiOP and ZiOPC models. The Vuong test results obtained from the OP, ZiOP, and ZiOPC models estimated on Besley and Persson’s (2009) data (reported below)  shows that the performance of the ZiOP and especially the ZiOPC model is superior to the OP model.    
```
ziopcpy.vuong_opiop(JCR_OP, ziop_JCR)

  -4.909399264831751

ziopcpy.vuong_opiopc(JCR_OP, ziopc_JCR)

  -5.424415009176218
```
