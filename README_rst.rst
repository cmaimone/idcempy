Overview
========
Discrete ordinal dependent variables often have excessive number of "zero" outcome.
Ziopc provides likelihood function and model estimation for the Zero-inflated Ordered Probit (ZiOP) model.
The ZiOP model is a mixture model that can account for the heterogeneity in the "zero" ofservations.
The Zero-inflated Ordered Probit with Correlated Errors (ZiOPC) assumes the two error terms are correlated with one another.
